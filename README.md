## About

Gain clear insights into important metrics about your customers, using Google Analytics with Cloudflare Zaraz integration.

To use it, you will need to create a Google Analytics account and set up Cloudflare Zaraz for Google Analytics. Note that the Google Analytics Identifier is not set up in this module; you need to insert your Google Analytics Identifier into the Cloudflare Zaraz dashboard.
